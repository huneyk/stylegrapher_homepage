# Introduction

Stylegrapher 스타일그래퍼 is a beautifully designed web site for a high-end beauty shop. This site not only presents a luxurious visual experience with stunning photo galleries of salon work and product offerings, but it also provides detailed service information and pricing presented in Korean. The goal is to attract new clients and offer a streamlined booking process, while ensuring that administrators can update content easily. The technology choices, from Flask to social media integrations, were made to ensure a fast, engaging, and reliable service, all while keeping future updates like multilingual support in mind.

# Frontend Technologies

The look and feel of the website is built with a combination of standard web languages, such as HTML for structure and CSS for styling, with a modern layout that accentuates the rich purple theme representing style and luxury. JavaScript is available to add interactivity when needed, like for simple animations or form validations. These tools help create a user interface that is both visually attractive and easy to navigate, ensuring that anyone visiting the site can appreciate the beauty and detail of the services being offered.

# Backend Technologies

At the core of the website is Flask, a well-known web framework in Python that facilitates the creation of dynamic and reliable web pages. The site uses SQLite as its database to store service details, appointment information, and pricing, providing a lightweight yet effective solution. Additionally, the site stores image files on the filesystem, making it straightforward to manage photo galleries that are regularly updated by the administrator. This backend setup is simple enough for easy maintenance while robust enough to handle daily operations of the beauty shop online.

# Infrastructure and Deployment

The project is designed to be hosted on a server that supports Python and Flask, ensuring that the website always operates smoothly. A version control system is used to manage updates and track changes efficiently, which aids in team collaboration and safe deployment of new features. Continuous integration and deployment pipelines help catch issues early, ensuring that the website remains reliable and is easily updated over time. These strategies guarantee that the website is scalable, dependable, and simple to deploy.

# Third-Party Integrations

To broaden its reach and enhance user engagement, the website integrates with popular social media platforms. Instagram, YouTube, and Thread APIs are used to display live feeds, making it easier for visitors to see the latest work and updates directly within the site. These integrations allow for showcasing creative content from social channels, contributing to SEO efforts and ensuring that prospective clients are able to see a wide range of impressive work samples. This connectivity is designed to make the user experience richer and more engaging while staying true to the brand's high-standard image.

# Security and Performance Considerations

Security measures have been woven into both the frontend and backend of the project. Form submissions for booking appointments are processed securely, and administrative access is protected through proper authentication measures. Data stored in SQLite is managed carefully to prevent common threats, and the website adopts standard practices to protect against issues like SQL injection. Performance is also a key focus; the front end is optimized to load quickly even with high-quality images, using techniques such as caching and lazy loading when necessary. This approach ensures that visitors have a smooth and safe browsing experience at all times.
