# Introduction

This application is a website built with Flask to showcase the beauty shop 'Stylegrapher 스타일그래퍼'. The main goal is to display high-quality photos of the shop and detailed information about the services offered, including personal photoshoots, profile shoots, makeup lessons, personal color diagnosis, makeup/hair styling, and fashion styling. The site is built primarily in Korean with plans for future multilingual support and uses a luxurious purple theme to reflect the brand's identity. Visitors get an elegant, visually engaging experience that not only familiarizes them with the services but also makes it easy to book appointments through a simple and intuitive contact form.

# Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up

When a new visitor enters the website, they are immediately greeted with a stunning landing page that displays the brand name and high-quality images of the shop. No account creation is required for general visitors; they can simply browse the site. However, if an administrator needs to update content such as service details, photo galleries, or pricing, there is a separate admin interface that requires sign in. The admin sign in process includes entering a username and password and, in case the credentials are forgotten, a password recovery process is available. While visitors can navigate freely without signing up, the admin login is secured and includes basic error handling for incorrect login details and a guided process to recover lost passwords.

# Main Dashboard or Home Page

After arriving at the site, the landing page serves as the main dashboard for visitors. The page immediately introduces the shop’s name 'Stylegrapher 스타일그래퍼' with striking visuals of the store and its work. The layout uses a clear navigation structure with links in the header to different parts of the website. Users can see clear calls to action for discovering service details, exploring a photo gallery, and navigating to the booking/contact form. The attractive and minimal design helps users easily find information, all while maintaining the luxurious purple theme that defines the site's visual identity.

# Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions

After landing on the homepage, users have a seamless journey to the service information pages. Detailed pages provide clear descriptions and pricing information for each service. Users can click on any service category to read more about what is offered and see professional photos that illustrate the service. Transitioning from service pages to the photo gallery is natural when a user clicks on the gallery link in the navigation menu. The photo gallery page displays high-quality images of the shop and examples of previous work. These images are updated regularly by an admin using a dedicated interface, so the gallery always reflects the most current work of the beauty shop. When a visitor is interested in a service and wants to book an appointment, they navigate to a booking and contact form page. The booking form is straightforward and requires users to enter basic information. Upon submission, a confirmation message tells the user that a representative will follow up through phone call or KakaoTalk. In addition, advanced workflows exist within the admin interface. Administrators can log in, navigate to a secure dashboard where they manage service details, update image galleries, and adjust pricing. Social media integrations are also visible on several pages, connecting the site with Instagram, YouTube, and Thread to show live feeds. These integrations make it easy for users to see the latest work and engage with the beauty shop's social media updates.

# Settings and Account Management

For general visitors, there is no extensive account management needed, as they freely browse without logging in. However, administrators have a dedicated area where they can manage all aspects of the site. In the admin interface, admins update personal information related to services, change pricing details, and add or remove images from the photo gallery. Notifications for appointment messages or server updates may be configured here as well. After making changes, users return to the main site as visitors, ensuring that the public view is always up to date with the latest improvements and updates. This admin area is designed to be simple and does not interfere with the public site, ensuring that backend updates are smooth and secure.

# Error States and Alternate Paths

If a visitor enters invalid data into the booking form, clear error messages prompt them to correct their inputs before resubmission. In situations where network connectivity is lost or a page fails to load, the web application displays fallback pages that explain the issue in simple Korean and offer an option to retry once the connection is restored. For admin users, wrong login attempts trigger error messages with instructions to verify the credentials or access the password recovery feature. In all cases, the design ensures that the user is informed clearly about what has gone wrong and is guided back to a normal flow without confusion.

# Conclusion and Overall App Journey

From the moment a visitor lands on the site to when they navigate the beautifully designed pages full of high-quality images and detailed services, the journey is designed to be intuitive and elegant. Users begin by exploring the luxurious landing page, learn about each service with easy to understand information, admire the updated photo galleries, and finally use the booking/contact form to request an appointment. Meanwhile, the admin interface ensures continuous up-to-date content management. Each element of the journey contributes to a cohesive experience that meets the needs of potential clients and reflects the high standards of 'Stylegrapher 스타일그래퍼'.
