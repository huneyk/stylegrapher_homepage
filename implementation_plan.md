Below is the detailed step-by-step implementation plan for building the Stylegrapher 스타일그래퍼 website using Flask, based on the PRD and project documents.

# Phase 1: Environment Setup

1.  Create a new project directory named `/stylegrapher` and open it in Cursor. (Reference: PRD Section 1 & Tech Stack)
2.  Initialize a Git repository inside `/stylegrapher` with branches `main` and `dev`. (Reference: PRD Section 7, Developer Best Practices)
3.  Create a Python virtual environment in the project root (`python -m venv venv`) and activate it. (Reference: Tech Stack: Backend)
4.  Install Flask and necessary libraries by running: • `pip install Flask` • `pip install flask_sqlalchemy` • `pip install flask_wtf` (for form handling and CSRF protection) (Reference: PRD Section 5; Tech Stack)
5.  **Validation**: Run `python -c "import flask; print(flask.__version__)"` to confirm Flask installation.

# Phase 2: Frontend Development

1.  Create a folder `/templates` in the project root for HTML templates. (Reference: file_structure_document)

2.  Create a base template `/templates/base.html` that includes common elements (header, footer, meta tags for SEO, link to CSS) and uses purple as the primary color in the inline style or linked stylesheet. (Reference: PRD Section 4, Frontend Guidelines)

3.  Create the landing page template `/templates/index.html` that displays the shop name "Stylegrapher 스타일그래퍼" and high-resolution photos. Include SEO meta tags and alt texts for images. (Reference: PRD Sections 1 & 4)

4.  Create additional templates for service information, gallery, and contact pages:

    *   `/templates/services.html` to list all services with descriptions and pricing in Korean. (Reference: PRD Section 4)
    *   `/templates/gallery.html` for the curated photo display. (Reference: PRD Section 4)
    *   `/templates/contact.html` that includes a contact/reservation form. (Reference: PRD Section 4)

5.  Create a static folder `/static/css` and add a stylesheet `style.css` to define the purple theme and overall elegant design. (Reference: PRD Section 4 & Frontend Guidelines)

6.  **Validation**: Open each HTML page in a browser (via Flask’s built-in server) and check that pages display correctly and that purple is the dominant color in the design.

# Phase 3: Backend Development

1.  In the project root, create an application file `/app.py` to initialize the Flask app. Configure the secret key, database URI for SQLite (e.g., `sqlite:///stylegrapher.db`), and register blueprints if needed. (Reference: PRD Section 5, Tech Stack Document)
2.  Set up SQLAlchemy in `/app.py` to manage service details, pricing information, and contact submissions. (Reference: PRD Section 5)
3.  Create models in a new file `/models.py` for:

*   Service (fields: id, name, description, price, etc.)
*   GalleryImage (fields: id, image_filename, caption)
*   Contact/Booking (fields: id, name, contact_info, selected_service, message, timestamp) (Reference: PRD Section 5 & Backend Structure Document)

1.  **Validation**: Launch a Python shell (`python`) and import models to ensure they are defined without error.
2.  Create routes in `/app.py` for rendering the pages:

*   GET `/` for the landing page (index.html)
*   GET `/services` to show the service information
*   GET `/gallery` for the photo gallery
*   GET and POST `/contact` for the contact/reservation form (Reference: PRD Section 3 & App Flow)

1.  Implement the admin interface:

*   Create a new blueprint in `/admin/routes.py` to handle admin login and content management (services, gallery images, pricing details).
*   Secure the admin routes using Flask-WTF forms and session-based authentication. (Reference: PRD Section 4 & Admin Interface)

1.  The admin interface should include routes to:

*   Upload and delete gallery images (images stored on the filesystem at e.g., `/static/uploads`)
*   Add, update, or delete service details in the SQLite database (Reference: PRD Section 4 & Tech Stack Document)

1.  Configure integration endpoints for social media APIs:

*   Create helper functions in `/helpers/social_media.py` for fetching Instagram and YouTube feeds. (For the Thread API, prepare a placeholder as integration details are to be added later.) (Reference: PRD Section 5 & Integration details)

1.  **Validation**: Run the Flask app (`flask run`) and visit each route to verify correct integration with templates and database functionality.

# Phase 4: Integration

1.  Connect frontend forms to the backend API by linking the HTML form actions (in `/templates/contact.html`) to the POST `/contact` route. Ensure form data is validated using Flask-WTF. (Reference: PRD Section 3 & Q&A: Booking Form)
2.  In the admin interface, integrate database CRUD operations so that any updates are immediately reflected on the public pages. (Reference: PRD Section 4 & Admin Interface)
3.  Enable social media content embedding by adding calls to helper functions within the appropriate templates (e.g., include Instagram feed in the landing page and YouTube video embed). (Reference: PRD Section 5)
4.  **Validation**: Use Postman or browser-based form submissions to test the booking form and verify that data is stored correctly in the SQLite database, and check that social media feeds appear as expected.

# Phase 5: Deployment

1.  Prepare a production configuration by creating a configuration file (e.g., `/config.py`) that loads environment-specific variables (secret key, debug mode off). (Reference: PRD Section 7, Non-Functional Requirements)
2.  Choose a WSGI server (e.g., Gunicorn) and add a `Procfile` (if deploying to a platform like Heroku) with: `web: gunicorn app:app`. (Reference: Deployment Guidelines)
3.  **Validation**: Run the app locally using Gunicorn (e.g., `gunicorn app:app`) and verify that the website works as expected in a production-like setting.

# Phase 6: Post-Launch

1.  Set up logging in the Flask application to capture errors and user interactions. (Reference: Security & Non-Functional Requirements)
2.  Schedule regular backups of the SQLite database by adding a cron job/script that runs `sqlite3 stylegrapher.db .dump > backups/backup_$(date +"%Y%m%d").sql`. (Reference: PRD Section 7)
3.  Monitor social media API integrations by adding error-handling logic in the `/helpers/social_media.py` functions; plan periodic reviews and updates of API keys. (Reference: Known Issues & Tech Stack Document)
4.  Plan for multilingual support by refactoring template text into configurable files or using Flask-Babel for language translations. (Reference: PRD Section 4 & Future Enhancements)
5.  **Validation**: Finally, perform end-to-end user testing, including booking a service and verifying that the admin interface handles updates correctly. Use browser developer tools and logging to confirm that SEO meta tags are correctly set and that all links and API integrations function well.

Notes: • Each step is isolated to enforce a single action per step. • All file paths and code placement are explicitly specified for clarity (e.g., `/templates`, `/static/css`, `/app.py`, `/models.py`, `/admin/routes.py`). • Testing/validation commands are provided after coding tasks to ensure the implementation meets all PRD requirements.

This plan will create a visually engaging, high-quality website for Stylegrapher 스타일그래퍼 while ensuring future scalability, security, and ease-of-management.
